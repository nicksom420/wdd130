      <p>
        [My website is going to be about me, in specific it will be resuming sight that talks about me and my work experience and anything that an employer would want to know about me when applying somewhere. The resume could list what educational experience I have and what I did during that time. What Job experiences I have at different places. What I did for those jobs and what skills I gained. How long have I worked at those places. How these jobs stack up against each other to show character and hard work as well as good job experience. As well as including my college experience and what I want to pursue. To just include everything about me so that the employer can stay hooked and see everything about me as detailed and quickly as possible. Since I am still in college, I should show education and foundational skills and potential as that could be the best indicator that an employer is looking for. Such as major and aspirations after college and activities I do on campus anything that could put me ahead of the pack. I could also include any high school experience since I am still young and that could still be relevant to who I am now.]

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        [. I could also use a cover letter. A cover letter is a good way to grab the attention of your employer immediately this can be on the second page where I can write my heart out and make the resume more personal. Cover letters are good as it allows me to show emotion and passion for the work I am doing, unlike normal resumes which lack that aspect to show that I could be more serious about getting that job or position. I already have a cover letter written and this could be a good way to get more content onto my page for the user to read. ]

      <p>
        [I might also make a page just about me if the employer has gotten that far. This could be my third page and just talks about where I grew up and stuff about my family and my hobbies. This could help to see if I could. I could also include any way to contact me such as a potential linkin link my social media my email or phone number. I could also include download or links to previous resumes Iâ€™ve had or contact information for previous employers. This could benifit me greatly as if the employer is interested they could get to know me a little all in the same step. They will have a good idea about me in the interview and could know if I will get along with the work atmosphere  ]
