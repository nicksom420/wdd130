        <p>I am pursuing software engineering as my degree. I took a year of general studies
            and decided to switch as I found a few coding classes quite fun. Hopefully this can be my future career.
        </p>
        <p>I love sports, I played soccer and highschool and have picked up volleyball up here at BYUI.
            I also have picked up going to the gym and find it fun and fullfilling. I am a big fan of various video games and your
            run of the mill tv shows and movies.
        </p>
        <p>I see many advantages to learning about careers in web design. Almost every company or business needs a website now adays.
            so the demand for such jobs are very high as well as career opportunity. I am taking this class as it is required for my major,
            I have also taken another class where we used HTML and Javascript, so some of this is already familiar to me and sounded fun to relearn using CSS.
            This was mentioned in class but most coding majors end up in some kind of web development sometime in their career. So I can see myself working
            in some sort of web development, or at least using it as a resume builder.
        </p>
        <p>I was born and raised in the church as both my parents were members who grew up in Utah. My favorite scripture was my late grandmas. It is Joshua 1:9.
            It states "Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest."
        This has always been a good comfort scripture of mine. It always reminds you that through Christ, you can find comfort and peace.
